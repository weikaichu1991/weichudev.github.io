                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Since</strong> I step my foot into tech, I learnt that anything related to technical engineering can be quite serious, daunting and frustrating. However, it is down to the creative minds of the engineers‚Äô to decide whether not we want to have fun in the process of solving the issue or dealing with the engineering challenged.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>That‚Äôs</strong> the reason why I call it ‚ÄúParty in the front, business in the back‚Äù. This inspired by the actual saying ‚ÄúParty in the front, business in the back‚Äù which used to describe the mullet hair. 
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Having</strong> a fun facade and friendly environment in front of the serious challenges make it easier to invite different part of people in to engage and discuss. There might be still a serious business purpose that needs to be addressed, but at least we will start things with creativity instead of despair.  Just like how I wish people can interact with my Dev Journal here, we can have proper technical conversation as long as we have fun.</li>
                        <li><strong>The</strong> title is also relevant to building a website. When I was building my website, it was the first time I really witnessed the potential grand architectures behind the apps we are using nowadays.</li>
                        <li><strong>I</strong> am fascinated by the mechanism between the backend components and a beautiful frontend interface, and how do they augment each other. A fun app needs sophisticated thinking processes in different aspects including security, human interaction, database modelling and cloud resource management, etc. That is fun at the front, business in the back! </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>New chapter, New approach</h2>
                <p class="note">
                    <P>There are 2 new chapters in my new tech life</P>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Since</strong> I put my first step forward into the tech industry a year ago after finishing my 15 years of life around architecture design, I am just constantly amazed by the amount of knowledge and possibility that I can pursue. It feels right! Feeling right isn‚Äôt because I hate my old profession and love the new one. I feel right is about how many transferable ways of design thinking I can bring into the tech world. To showcase and share what I really mean, there is no better way I can think of than having my own platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recently</strong> I finished my journey with the previous company which introduce me into Cloud Architecture, Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps. As soon as I closed the chapter with my previous role as an associate, I knew immediately that this is a grand opening of my tech life in the Devops and developer world. Similar to my previous life as an architectural designer, creativity doesn‚Äôt stop when you are not working for someone. This personal website is the way that helps me capture my creativity, showcase it and bring people along with me onto my journey! </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>A portfolio journal</h2>
                <p class="note">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>My</strong> website ‚ÄúWei‚Äôs Dev Journal‚Äù is a portfolio for my tech works, a learning log for my tech learning, an ideas library for my tech creation and a journey for my tech life.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>It</strong> documents things what I have achieved, what I can achieve and what I want to achieve. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>I</strong> am not from the computer science background, so I need everyone to be my teacher and my lifetime learning mate. Either as a feedback, an encouragement or simple suggestions of books, articles and events, I know they will be helpful to me in some way.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <!-- The end of step 02 -->
                <h2>A beginner Full-stack project</h2>
                <p class="note">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>After</strong> I left my previous role as an SRE associate, I decided to build this personal website as my first full-stack exercise before I throw myself into job hunting process.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Full-stack</strong> is something that I have been wanting to put my hands on since I started working in the backend role. I can argue that it is because I am from a designer world which I generally classified as a frontend field but involved different technical skills (I still got myself to sit down to learn some HTML, CSS and JS though). I suddenly saw the chance of having a full circle moment and thought ‚ÄúWhy not give full-stack a go?‚Äù. So I got myself hooked on to a Fullstack web deign tutorial and built this simple website for myself which I can use through out my new career life. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>I</strong> know that there are still many things I can add to this website project and making it more sophisticated. But based on what we have here, I am glad that I have laid down the first brick before I can build the colosseum-scale full-stack architecture, and I need everyone to give me ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù (see what I did there! üòâ) opinions of things I can try to improve or add to the website.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Or!</strong> just simply‚Ä¶ watch this space! </li>
